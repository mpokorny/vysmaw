# Size of memory region for storing spectra retrieved via RDMA from the CBE. The
# memory region is allocated and registered for RDMA by the library. Memory
# registration affects memory management on the host, as it pins physical memory
# in the virtual address space -- too large an allocation may be detrimental to
# the application; too little, and the library may be unable to copy the data
# from the CBE when it becomes available, resulting in lost data. Note that one
# memory region of the given size will be allocated for every size of spectrum
# that is received by the client unless 'single_spectrum_buffer_pool' is true.

# data streams resulting in many client read requests, the backlog can
# accumulate very quickly, and will take some time to resolve.
